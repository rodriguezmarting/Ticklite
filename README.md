## Setup
Ticklite uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to fake a backend for now.
Open two tabs in your terminal to run both the app and the server:
- App: `npm start`
- Server: `json-server --watch db.js --port 2020`

This app is created with a [mobile first](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00) approach, running it with [responsive mode](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode?hl=en) is recommended.
